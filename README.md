# 🎨 p5.js Creative Coding Assignment

This repository contains two modified p5.js sketches, duplicated from the p5.js Editor examples and then significantly modified to explore variables, color, graphics, and gameplay mechanics.

## 🖼️ Experiment Summaries

### 1. Enhanced Snake Game (Sketch_1_Snake)

**Original Sketch Name:** Snake game

**Modifications:**
* **Controls:** **W, A, S, D** for standard gaming controls.
* **Graphics:** Implemented a detailed **brick wall** boundary texture. The snake is drawn as clear circles, and food has a pulsing effect.
* **Gameplay:** Added a **Bonus Fruit** that appears every 10 points, offering +5 score and +5 segments, but lasts only 6 seconds, creating a strategic challenge.
* **Feedback:** Incorporated a **particle celebration effect** whenever food is eaten.

### 2. Dynamic Rotating Nebula (Sketch_2_Nebula)

**Original Sketch Name:** *Based on Generative Art principles*

**Modifications:**
* **Canvas & Color:** Set to `800x600` with an HSB color mode, utilizing a dark background and a two-color interpolation (magenta to cyan) for the particles.
* **Animation:** Implemented a **3D perspective effect** using Z-depth to simulate a rotating particle cloud or nebula.
* **Interaction:** The **mouse X-position** directly controls the rotation speed of the entire cloud, making the sketch interactive.
* **Variables:** Explicit variables (`NUM_POINTS`, `RADIUS`) were defined to easily control the density and size of the nebula.
